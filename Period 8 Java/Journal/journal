Goal for today: I will research the several ways people make games savable on stock overflow
and see if there's something we could adapt to our game.
Today : I filled out the survey, played around with design concepts and also schemed against the unforseen 
spying of another group and came up with a plan.

Goal for today: Make food draggable to feed the dragons instead of the hungry button
Today: I figured out with Mr.Nockle's help how to set up food to be draggable as well as refreshed on where our code is
For monday I hope to finish the food to be draggable and pass it off to jenniber to make the dragons feedable 
through the food being dropped

Goal: try to finish the DragonFood class. 
Today: I made dragonfood replicate the idea behind how clickables are initialized. So basically it checks viewObjects and adds
an object to the draggable array if it is an instanceof draggable. Then using mousedragged it should follow the mouse when the little
food berry is clicked. However, right now there are no errors yet it doesnt work when I try to drag. Tomorrow I want to get the full
functionality.

Goal: I wanted to make the berry draggable
Today: The issue was that the mouse motion listener wasnt instentiating, so it never called the methods to drag. Then I also made 
sure that the mouse woulda always be in the middle of the berry. Finally, when released the berry falls into original position. 
Then with Mr.Nockles I made sure that no matter how fast the mouse moves, once the berry is begining to be dragged it will always follow
the mouse

Goal: Make game working on mine and violetta's macs
Today: I made berries to feed the Dragon. I removed the action from the button. Instead to feed the dragons, I  call a method in 
Jennibers class that removes a hungry box if the berry is overlaying one of the draggons on mouse release
also i was trying to make the program runnable on my Mac.

Goal: To make a polygon shaped button for our posts.
Today: First I tried using a tutorial but that got too confusing. So instead I made a new class that's a clickable. 
The button works the only issue is that I can't see the polygon at the moment so I have to figure out how to make it visible to test
it and position the buttons
