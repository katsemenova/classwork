Goal for today: I will research the several ways people make games savable on stock overflow
and see if there's something we could adapt to our game.
Today : I filled out the survey, played around with design concepts and also schemed against the unforseen 
spying of another group and came up with a plan.

Goal for today: Make food draggable to feed the dragons instead of the hungry button
Today: I figured out with Mr.Nockle's help how to set up food to be draggable as well as refreshed on where our code is
For monday I hope to finish the food to be draggable and pass it off to jenniber to make the dragons feedable 
through the food being dropped
