Goal for today: I will research the several ways people make games savable on stock overflow
and see if there's something we could adapt to our game.
Today : I filled out the survey, played around with design concepts and also schemed against the unforseen 
spying of another group and came up with a plan.

Goal for today: Make food draggable to feed the dragons instead of the hungry button
Today: I figured out with Mr.Nockle's help how to set up food to be draggable as well as refreshed on where our code is
For monday I hope to finish the food to be draggable and pass it off to jenniber to make the dragons feedable 
through the food being dropped

Goal: try to finish the DragonFood class. 
Today: I made dragonfood replicate the idea behind how clickables are initialized. So basically it checks viewObjects and adds
an object to the draggable array if it is an instanceof draggable. Then using mousedragged it should follow the mouse when the little
food berry is clicked. However, right now there are no errors yet it doesnt work when I try to drag. Tomorrow I want to get the full
functionality.
